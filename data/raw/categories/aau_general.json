      "Addis Ababa University has been led by presidents who have taken the university on a path of great accomplishments and national and continental prominence, expanding its faculties, promoting research, and fostering international partnerships.  Since its founding as the University College of Addis Ababa in 1950, there have been 14 presidents, two of them expatriates, with different academic backgrounds and histories.",
      "Lucien Matte SJ (1907–1973) was a Canadian Jesuit priest and educator. He was President of the University of Sudbury and and the founding president of Addis Ababa University. In 1946, Emperor Haile Selassie, who favoured the Jesuit educational philosophy, asked Matte to help organize the country's educational system. The emperor followed this in 1950 with a request that Matte help establish a university. This maiden postsecondary establishment was named the University College of Addis Ababa (now Addis Ababa University) and Matte served as President from 1952 to 1962. He then served as president of the University of Sudbury from 1962 to 1966",
      "He was the first Ethiopian President of Haile Selassie I University. After serving in the Private Office of the Emperor, he skilfully led the University during the first critical decade of the University. He was skilful at negotiating and calming students during a period of increasing radicalization and protecting students and the University from intrusion by the government.",
      "Dr. Aklilu Habte belonged to the first cohort of graduates of the University College of Addis Ababa. As the second Ethiopian president, he led the University at a time of fierce confrontation between radical students and the imperial government. Dr Aklilu also served as the first Ethiopian Dean of the Faculty of Education before his brief period of presidency.",
      "Dr. Taye led AAU as President in the tumultuous times that followed the resignation of Dr. Aklilu and other key members of the administration in the aftermath of the Ethiopian Revolution. His presidency oversaw the Edget Behibret Zemecha (Development through co-operation enlightenment and work) which mobilized university students in national mass literacy programs and rural development.",
      "Dr. Duri was President of AAU twice: (1976-1985) and (1993-1995). In both terms of office, he was appointed as a crisis leader to restore normalcy at the University following periods of instability. After he was brought in as “Caretaker administrator” by the Derg, he soon assumed full mantle as President. He was responsible “for the respectable survival of the university, with much of its integrity intact during the most difficult years.” In 1993, he was appointed as President following the crisis of January 1993 that led to the closure of the University for several months and dismissal of the top University leadership.",
      "An academic administrator at HSIU during the imperial days and the early Derg period, Dr. Abiy Kifle became President when the University under Dr. Duri’s leadership was returning to normalcy. His period saw steady consolidation of the university but also witnessed student protests in later years. The presidency was also marred by the decision to send students and staff for national campaigns in Metekal and Gambella (1985) and conscription of students into the armed forces towards the end of the civil war in 1991.",
      "Professor Alemayehu was the first President of the University to be elected by the university community. His tenure was cut short because of the crisis of January1993 which pitted students against government security forces. The President and his VP’s were dismissed from their positions for endorsing the call for a thorough investigation of the violence directed against students.",

An exceptionally prolific researcher with an impressive track record of scientific publications in leading journals in his area of microbiology, he was promoted to full professor in November 1998. As President, Professor Mogessie was instrumental in the signing of a number of cooperation agreements between AAU and foreign universities.",
      "Professor Eshetu was the second President of the University who was elected through the active participation of the University community. His tenure opened auspiciously with the holding of a three-week long conference between the University community and the Prime Minister in the summer of 2002 that envisaged a new period of University-Government relations. However, this honeymoon ended shortly with Prof. Eshetu and his VP’s resigning in December 2002 protesting the imposition of a new staff assessment system over the University by the Ministry of Education.",

In 1946, Emperor Haile Selassie, who favoured the Jesuit educational philosophy, asked Matte to help organize the country's educational system. The emperor followed this in 1950 with a request that Matte help establish a university. This maiden postsecondary establishment was named the University College of Addis Ababa (now Addis Ababa University) and Matte served as President from 1952 to 1962. He then served as president of the University of Sudbury from 1962 to 1966",
      "He was the first Ethiopian President of Haile Selassie I University.

He was responsible “for the respectable survival of the university, with much of its integrity intact during the most difficult years.” In 1993, he was appointed as President following the crisis of January 1993 that led to the closure of the University for several months and dismissal of the top University leadership.",
