      "Addis Ababa University (AAU) continues to play a leading role in advancing Ethiopia’s health entrepreneurship ecosystem through evidence-based capacity building and strong institutional collaboration.",
      "From 9–18 January 2026, the Africa Health Collaborative (AHC) at AAU, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, successfully conducted a 10-day Training of Trainers (ToT) program. The training brought together 54 faculty members from Addis Ababa University (21) and partner universities—Debre Berhan University (11), Wolkite University (11), and Wollo University (11).",
      "The ToT program aimed to strengthen institutional capacity to deliver high-quality health entrepreneurship education and to promote harmonized, competency-based training approaches across participating universities. Participants received intensive training on 11 comprehensive health entrepreneurship modules, alongside advanced facilitation techniques, adult learning principles, learner-centered pedagogy, assessment methods, and practical instructional tools.",
      "The program emphasized experiential learning, contextual relevance, and quality assurance to ensure academic rigor, consistency, and measurable learning outcomes. Through the integration of skills, knowledge, and attitudes, the training equipped faculty members to deliver engaging, hands-on learning experiences. It also highlighted the value of co-facilitation between health and business experts in enriching health entrepreneurship education.",
      "By strengthening the pedagogical and technical competencies of trainers, the initiative creates a sustainable multiplier effect, enabling universities to mentor and nurture the next generation of health innovators and entrepreneurs. These future leaders are expected to contribute solutions to priority health system challenges and expand access to quality primary healthcare in Ethiopia.",
      "This milestone underscores AAU-AHC’s commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and societal impact, while aligning with the Mastercard Foundation’s mission to advance inclusive and scalable solutions that empower young people and institutions.",

      "On January 9, 2026, the Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) at Addis Ababa University (AAU) convened a symposium focusing on \"Ethiopian Islamic Manuscript Traditions\" in the Ras Mekonnen Hall. The event attracted a diverse assembly of scholars and professionals from fields including linguistics, cultural studies, philology, and anthropology.",
      "Dr. Yohannes Adgeh, Director of the IES, elaborated on the institute's commitment to interdisciplinary research through its four specialized centres: the Centre for the Study of Ethiopian History and Society, the Centre for Ethiopian Languages and Cultures, the Centre for Indigenous Knowledge and Research, and the Centre for Museum Studies. He reflected on Ethiopia's rich heritage of indigenous knowledge, emphasizing its historical role as a repository of multicultural and multilingual traditions.",
      "“Ethiopia stands out as one of the few nations with its own unique writing system that has facilitated the transfer of knowledge across generations,” Dr. Yohannes remarked. He asserted that Islamic manuscripts constitute an integral literary heritage, with several preserved at the IES for ongoing research and scholarly inquiry, contributing to the understanding of Ethiopian philosophy and wisdom.",
      "The symposium highlighted the critical importance of documenting and preserving Islamic manuscripts, which have historically conveyed religious teachings both orally and through written texts. Dr. Yohannes called for collaborative efforts among scholars and institutions to enhance the study, documentation, and preservation of these invaluable artefacts.",
      "In his concluding remarks, Dr. Yohannes urged citizens and institutions to actively engage in the safeguarding of manuscripts, particularly encouraging individuals to transfer personal collections to the IES to prevent deterioration and loss. Such proactive measures, he argued, are essential for ensuring that future generations can appreciate and benefit from the aesthetic and scholarly value of these texts.",
      "International researchers Professor Alessandro Gori and Dr. Anne Regourd delivered thought-provoking presentations, which ignited an engaging discussion among participants. Professor Gori commenced the proceedings by establishing foundational definitions and terminology related to manuscript traditions while detailing the significant presence of Islamic manuscripts within the Ethiopian context, a phenomenon that has flourished since the advent of paper. He highlighted the vital social roles of practitioners, such as calligraphers, in preserving these manuscripts.",
      "Dr. Regourd followed with her analysis of the Harari collection housed in the Abdallah Sharif Museum found in Harar, focusing on Waqf notes dating back to the 17th century. Her research underscored the cultural and historical significance of such manuscripts.",
      "In summarizing the discussions, Professor Gori emphasized that the Ethiopian Islamic Manuscript Tradition encompasses a spectrum of life under the umbrella of religion, engaging with themes of philosophy, psychology, culture, astronomy, sociology, art, and language.",

      "In a significant public lecture held at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) at Addis Ababa University (AAU), Prof. Samuel Rubenson, son of renowned Swedish historian Prof. Sven Rubenson, shared the profound impact of his father's work on Ethiopian history. The event also marked the donation of eight boxes of valuable archival materials collected by Prof. Sven Rubenson, further enriching IES's resources.",
      "Dr. Yohannes Adgeh, Director of IES, opened the event by highlighting Prof. Sven Rubenson's pivotal role in establishing the history department at AAU and his enduring contributions to the IES. Originally arriving in Ethiopia as an evangelist, Prof. Rubenson transitioned to academia, recognizing Ethiopia's advanced Christian traditions. His focus on Ethiopian history not only facilitated academic growth but also nurtured a new generation of Ethiopian historians, including prominent figures such as Prof. Shiferaw Bekele and Prof. Bahru Zewdie.",
      "“Prof. Rubenson's efforts in digitizing Ethiopian manuscripts have greatly improved access to historical references, benefiting students, educators, and researchers across various institutions,” Dr. Yohannes noted. His seminal work, The Survival of Ethiopian Independence, is lauded for illuminating Ethiopia's struggle for autonomy and its significance within the broader African context.",
      "In his keynote address, Magnes Lennartsson, Ambassador of Sweden to Ethiopia, emphasized the long-standing cooperative relationship between Ethiopia and Sweden, which has flourished for nearly 80 years. He highlighted the successful collaboration through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), which has led to the construction of over 6,000 elementary schools across Ethiopia. “We look forward to deepening our partnership in various areas, including research and knowledge sharing with AAU,” Lennartsson stated.",
      "Dr. Zelalem Tefera, head of the Centre for the Study of Ethiopian History and Society at IES, discussed the lasting legacy of Prof. Sven Rubenson. “His exhaustive studies on Ethiopian unity and freedom during the colonial era offer invaluable insights into the nation’s history,” he noted. Having lived in Ethiopia for many years, Rubenson's work has not only documented Ethiopian heritage but also facilitated connections between Ethiopian scholars and global academic networks.",
      "Prof. Samuel Rubenson reflected on his father’s 65-year dedication to Ethiopia, encapsulating his contributions under three headings: the call, the conversion, and the contribution. He reiterated the significance of the archival materials donated, stating that they represent a new era of research opportunities in Ethiopian history.",
      "The event also commemorated the IES's contributions to scholarly activities as part of AAU's 75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary. Through international collaboration, IES aims to bridge gaps between local and international researchers, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of Ethiopian history, society, politics, and economic endeavours.",
      "In light of ongoing efforts to reclaim Ethiopia's historical heritage, Prof. Rubenson’s initiatives in documenting and preserving Ethiopian history through microfilming and archiving have opened vital avenues for future research, ensuring that the voices and stories of Ethiopians are recognized and preserved for generations to come.",

      "On January 9, 2026, the Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) at Addis Ababa University (AAU) convened a symposium focusing on \"Ethiopian Islamic Manuscript Traditions\" in the Ras Mekonnen Hall. The event attracted a diverse assembly of scholars and professionals from fields including linguistics, cultural studies, philology, and anthropology.",
      "Dr. Yohannes Adgeh, Director of the IES, elaborated on the institute's commitment to interdisciplinary research through its four specialized centres: the Centre for the Study of Ethiopian History and Society, the Centre for Ethiopian Languages and Cultures, the Centre for Indigenous Knowledge and Research, and the Centre for Museum Studies. He reflected on Ethiopia's rich heritage of indigenous knowledge, emphasizing its historical role as a repository of multicultural and multilingual traditions.",
      "“Ethiopia stands out as one of the few nations with its own unique writing system that has facilitated the transfer of knowledge across generations,” Dr. Yohannes remarked. He asserted that Islamic manuscripts constitute an integral literary heritage, with several preserved at the IES for ongoing research and scholarly inquiry, contributing to the understanding of Ethiopian philosophy and wisdom.",
      "The symposium highlighted the critical importance of documenting and preserving Islamic manuscripts, which have historically conveyed religious teachings both orally and through written texts. Dr. Yohannes called for collaborative efforts among scholars and institutions to enhance the study, documentation, and preservation of these invaluable artefacts.",
      "In his concluding remarks, Dr. Yohannes urged citizens and institutions to actively engage in the safeguarding of manuscripts, particularly encouraging individuals to transfer personal collections to the IES to prevent deterioration and loss. Such proactive measures, he argued, are essential for ensuring that future generations can appreciate and benefit from the aesthetic and scholarly value of these texts.",
      "International researchers Professor Alessandro Gori and Dr. Anne Regourd delivered thought-provoking presentations, which ignited an engaging discussion among participants. Professor Gori commenced the proceedings by establishing foundational definitions and terminology related to manuscript traditions while detailing the significant presence of Islamic manuscripts within the Ethiopian context, a phenomenon that has flourished since the advent of paper. He highlighted the vital social roles of practitioners, such as calligraphers, in preserving these manuscripts.",
      "Dr. Regourd followed with her analysis of the Harari collection housed in the Abdallah Sharif Museum found in Harar, focusing on Waqf notes dating back to the 17th century. Her research underscored the cultural and historical significance of such manuscripts.",
      "In summarizing the discussions, Professor Gori emphasized that the Ethiopian Islamic Manuscript Tradition encompasses a spectrum of life under the umbrella of religion, engaging with themes of philosophy, psychology, culture, astronomy, sociology, art, and language.",

      "In a significant public lecture held at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) at Addis Ababa University (AAU), Prof. Samuel Rubenson, son of renowned Swedish historian Prof. Sven Rubenson, shared the profound impact of his father's work on Ethiopian history. The event also marked the donation of eight boxes of valuable archival materials collected by Prof. Sven Rubenson, further enriching IES's resources.",
      "Dr. Yohannes Adgeh, Director of IES, opened the event by highlighting Prof. Sven Rubenson's pivotal role in establishing the history department at AAU and his enduring contributions to the IES. Originally arriving in Ethiopia as an evangelist, Prof. Rubenson transitioned to academia, recognizing Ethiopia's advanced Christian traditions. His focus on Ethiopian history not only facilitated academic growth but also nurtured a new generation of Ethiopian historians, including prominent figures such as Prof. Shiferaw Bekele and Prof. Bahru Zewdie.",
      "“Prof. Rubenson's efforts in digitizing Ethiopian manuscripts have greatly improved access to historical references, benefiting students, educators, and researchers across various institutions,” Dr. Yohannes noted. His seminal work, The Survival of Ethiopian Independence, is lauded for illuminating Ethiopia's struggle for autonomy and its significance within the broader African context.",
      "In his keynote address, Magnes Lennartsson, Ambassador of Sweden to Ethiopia, emphasized the long-standing cooperative relationship between Ethiopia and Sweden, which has flourished for nearly 80 years. He highlighted the successful collaboration through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), which has led to the construction of over 6,000 elementary schools across Ethiopia. “We look forward to deepening our partnership in various areas, including research and knowledge sharing with AAU,” Lennartsson stated.",
      "Dr. Zelalem Tefera, head of the Centre for the Study of Ethiopian History and Society at IES, discussed the lasting legacy of Prof. Sven Rubenson. “His exhaustive studies on Ethiopian unity and freedom during the colonial era offer invaluable insights into the nation’s history,” he noted. Having lived in Ethiopia for many years, Rubenson's work has not only documented Ethiopian heritage but also facilitated connections between Ethiopian scholars and global academic networks.",
      "Prof. Samuel Rubenson reflected on his father’s 65-year dedication to Ethiopia, encapsulating his contributions under three headings: the call, the conversion, and the contribution. He reiterated the significance of the archival materials donated, stating that they represent a new era of research opportunities in Ethiopian history.",
      "The event also commemorated the IES's contributions to scholarly activities as part of AAU's 75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary. Through international collaboration, IES aims to bridge gaps between local and international researchers, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of Ethiopian history, society, politics, and economic endeavours.",
      "In light of ongoing efforts to reclaim Ethiopia's historical heritage, Prof. Rubenson’s initiatives in documenting and preserving Ethiopian history through microfilming and archiving have opened vital avenues for future research, ensuring that the voices and stories of Ethiopians are recognized and preserved for generations to come.",

      "Addis Ababa University (AAU) continues to play a leading role in advancing Ethiopia’s health entrepreneurship ecosystem through evidence-based capacity building and strong institutional collaboration.",
      "From 9–18 January 2026, the Africa Health Collaborative (AHC) at AAU, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, successfully conducted a 10-day Training of Trainers (ToT) program. The training brought together 54 faculty members from Addis Ababa University (21) and partner universities—Debre Berhan University (11), Wolkite University (11), and Wollo University (11).",
      "Prof. Assefa Abegaz, Project Manager and Co-Principal Investigator of AHC-AAU, officially opened the Health Entrepreneurship TOT by introducing the Africa Health Collaborative as a multi-stakeholder partnership dedicated to advancing health and well-being across Africa. He highlighted the initiative’s focus on three core pillars-Health Employment, Health Entrepreneurship, and Health Ecosystems - with particular attention to youth, women and internally displaced people.",
      "The ToT program aimed to strengthen institutional capacity to deliver high-quality health entrepreneurship education and to promote harmonized, competency-based training approaches across participating universities. Participants received intensive training on 11 comprehensive health entrepreneurship modules, alongside advanced facilitation techniques, adult learning principles, learner-centered pedagogy, assessment methods, and practical instructional tools.",
      "The program emphasized experiential learning, contextual relevance, and quality assurance to ensure academic rigor, consistency, and measurable learning outcomes. Through the integration of skills, knowledge, and attitudes, the training equipped faculty members to deliver engaging, hands-on learning experiences. It also highlighted the value of co-facilitation between health and business experts in enriching health entrepreneurship education.",
      "By strengthening the pedagogical and technical competencies of trainers, the initiative creates a sustainable multiplier effect, enabling universities to mentor and nurture the next generation of health innovators and entrepreneurs. These future leaders are expected to contribute solutions to priority health system challenges and expand access to quality primary healthcare in Ethiopia.",
      "This milestone underscores AAU-AHC’s commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and societal impact, while aligning with the Mastercard Foundation’s mission to advance inclusive and scalable solutions that empower young people and institutions.",
      "The collaboration directly supports national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals, reinforcing AAU’s position as a center of excellence in health innovation and entrepreneurship in Ethiopia and across the African region.",
