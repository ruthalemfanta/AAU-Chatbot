With a Ph.D. in Hydrogeology from the Free University of Amsterdam, and advanced degrees in groundwater surveying (ITC, Enschede) and hydrology (IHE, Delft), alongside a B.Sc. in Geology from Addis Ababa University, he exemplified academic excellence and professional commitment.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, colleagues, students, and all who had the privilege of working with him. \n\nHis Funeral will be held today at Arat Kilo Kidist Selassie Church at 3 pm \n\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace.",

His daughter, Yemariam Sintayehu, was a freshman student at Addis Ababa University in 2017 E.C.\n\nSadly, Yemariam is currently suffering from a severe mental health disorder, which has forced her to withdraw from her studies. She is undergoing intensive and long-term medical treatment, the cost of which is estimated at 10,000,000 ETB. The family has exhausted all available financial resources and properties and is no longer able to cover the treatment expenses.\n\nIn view of this critical situation, we humbly appeal to all students and compassionate individuals, in the name of God, to extend any possible medical or financial support to help save Yemariam’s life.\n\nBank Details for Support:\nCommercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)\nAccount Number: 1000018352846\n\nYour generosity, prayers, and solidarity will make a profound difference during this difficult time.\n\nWith sincere gratitude,",

The remaining balance will be disbursed next month.\n\nPlease note that Sefere Selam and Tikur Anbessa colleges are continuing their cost sharing payments as scheduled.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the cost sharing process, feel free to reach out to the Student Council.\n\n@ctbe_student_council\n\nThank you for your patient !!\nCTBE Student Council",

Can self-sponsored students change their initial department or placement secured during University Entrance?\n\nAnswer: No. This is not possible unless we receive an official notification from the Main Registrar. We will maintain the departments as officially reported to us.\n\n2. I am a self-sponsored student who secured a department/placement during University Entrance, but my name is not included in the department list sent from the main Registrar. Can you verify and complete my placement?\n\nAnswer: We cannot verify or process such cases. The Main Registrar must send us official information for any placement action to be taken.\n\n\n3. Is there any possibility of requesting a transfer?\n\nAnswer: At this time,** transfer requests**—either to leave CTBE or to change departments within CTBE—are **not allowed.  A student should stay in the placed department at least one semester.**\n\n\n4. I failed to fill out the preference form on time. What will happen?\n\nAnswer: Students who did not fill and submit the form on time will still be placed, how, refer the information communicated during the orientation session.\n\n---\n\nNB:\nMost of these questions were already covered during the orientation session and are available in the slides and recorded video shared with you.

    "text": "[Placement - 2018] - Update\n(CTBE - Year II (2017 Entry) Students)\n\nHere are some of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) received through our emails and office following the placement results.\nPlease note that questions already addressed during the orientation session will not be repeated here.\n\n\n1. Can self-sponsored students change their initial department or placement secured during University Entrance?\n\nAnswer: No. This is not possible unless we receive an official notification from the Main Registrar. We will maintain the departments as officially reported to us.\n\n2. I am a self-sponsored student who secured a department/placement during University Entrance, but my name is not included in the department list sent from the main Registrar. Can you verify and complete my placement?\n\nAnswer: We cannot verify or process such cases. The Main Registrar must send us official information for any placement action to be taken.\n\n\n3. Is there any possibility of requesting a transfer?\n\nAnswer: At this time,** transfer requests**—either to leave CTBE or to change departments within CTBE—are **not allowed.  A student should stay in the placed department at least one semester.**\n\n\n4. I failed to fill out the preference form on time. What will happen?\n\nAnswer: Students who did not fill and submit the form on time will still be placed, how, refer the information communicated during the orientation session.\n\n---\n\nNB:\nMost of these questions were already covered during the orientation session and are available in the slides and recorded video shared with you. Those who missed the session are advised to consult your classmates or review our previous posts.\n\nThe PECC/TLS Office \n\n@Hsquareedu",

While the administration moved forward with this specific vendor independently, we are hopeful that the change finally brings the quality we’ve been asking for.\n\n**The Reality of the Change:**\n**Better Service:** We expect a significant upgrade from the previous provider.\n**Higher Prices:** Quality comes at a cost, and we’ve noted the price increases.\n**Our Role:** We are here to ensure that if you are paying more, you are actually getting more.\n\nWe aren't promising that this new setup is perfect, but we are promising that **your voices will be the loudest in the room.** We will be monitoring the quality of food and service closely over the next few weeks.\n\n**Try it out and let us know: Is the new service actually better?** We are your bridge to the administration—help us hold them to a higher standard.",

For now, old cafeteria furniture will be used, and there’s a plan to possibly move it to a new location.\n• The campus will be adding benches and lights around the garden areas to make them more comfortable for students.\n• ATM installation is delayed because of construction near the gate, but all student service spots will be compelled to start accepting Telebirr and mobile banking.\n• Indoor games like table tennis are on the way, and students can catch football matches on DSTV.\n• Wi-Fi in Saba male dorm will be improved to cover all areas.\n• Dorm issues for non-freshman male students are being addressed — especially for those from outside Addis.\n\n**More updates coming soon!**\n– CNCS Student Council",

Can self-sponsored students change their initial department or placement secured during University Entrance?\n\nAnswer: No. This is not possible unless we receive an official notification from the Main Registrar. We will maintain the departments as officially reported to us.\n\n2. I am a self-sponsored student who secured a department/placement during University Entrance, but my name is not included in the department list sent from the main Registrar. Can you verify and complete my placement?\n\nAnswer: We cannot verify or process such cases. The Main Registrar must send us official information for any placement action to be taken.\n\n\n3. Is there any possibility of requesting a transfer?\n\nAnswer: At this time,** transfer requests**—either to leave CTBE or to change departments within CTBE—are **not allowed.  A student should stay in the placed department at least one semester.**\n\n\n4. I failed to fill out the preference form on time. What will happen?\n\nAnswer: Students who did not fill and submit the form on time will still be placed, how, refer the information communicated during the orientation session.\n\n---\n\nNB:\nMost of these questions were already covered during the orientation session and are available in the slides and recorded video shared with you.

The program began in collaboration with the then Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAiT), with 10 Ethiopian students participating in its first year. Many of these students have since gone on to pursue MSc and PhD programs at leading universities.\n\nIn later years, the program briefly expanded to include students from the University of Rwanda. Unfortunately, the program was paused last year due to uncertainties with U.S. visa processing. However, I’m pleased to share that the program will resume this year with a focus on recruiting Ethiopian students from the following units:\n\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\nSchool of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering\n\nSchool of Information Technology & Engineering\n\nCenter for Biomedical Engineering\n\nDepartment of Computer Science\n\nI kindly request your support in sharing this opportunity with the relevant schools and centers so that interested 4th-year (3rd year in case of Computer Science) students may apply.\n\nApplication link: https://forms.gle/TyLAKeUFs6ESYnj87\nApplication deadline: January 22, 2026\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nWarm regards,",

    "text": "sales process directly into the insurance context adapted for insurance agents:  \n\n1. Prospecting – identifying potential clients such as individuals, families, or businesses who may need coverage (motor, property, life, liability, etc.). This often involves networking, referrals, and partnerships with banks or SACCOs.  \n\n2. Qualifying – assessing whether the prospect has insurable assets, the financial capacity to pay premiums, and the authority to make decisions. For example, checking if a business owner is the policy decision-maker or if a family has budget for life insurance.  \n\n3. Presenting – explaining insurance products in simple, relatable terms. Demonstrate how motor insurance protects against accidents, or how life insurance secures family stability. Tailor presentations to the client’s risks and priorities.  \n\n4. Handling objections – addressing common concerns like “insurance is too expensive,” “claims take too long,” or “I don’t trust insurers.” Provide clear evidence of claim processes, customer testimonials, and regulatory compliance to build confidence.  \n\n5. Closing – guiding the client to sign the policy agreement, finalize premium payments, and issue the cover note. In insurance, closing often requires patience and reassurance, since clients are committing to long-term protection.  \n\n6. Follow-up – maintaining the relationship through renewal reminders, claims support, and periodic check-ins. This stage is critical in insurance: satisfied clients often bring referrals and cross-sell opportunities (e.g., a motor client later buying property or health insurance).",

    "text": "**About Cover Letter,Resume & CV(Curriculum Vitae) **\n                             \n\n**✅1. What Is Cover Letter? **\n\n✔️A cover letter includes general details about a person like name, contact information, educational and professional qualification, work experience and career goal or what a person is looking for in terms of a job profile. A cover letter should not be confused with a resume as it does not include all the details of a resume. \n\n✔️A cover letter is an introduction to yourself with regard to the job opening you are applying for. Cover letters are generally one page at most in length, divided into a header, introduction, body, and closing.\n\n✔️Cover letter typically includes your contact information, addresses the hiring Company/Organization, and is tailored to a specific job posting or company.\n\n**✅2. What Is Difference Between a Resume and a CV (Curriculum Vitae) **\n\n✔️A resume is a one- to two-page document presenting key facts about your professional experience, educational background, and skills. A CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a longer document that details the whole course of your career. A resume is used for job search, and a CV for academic purposes.\n\n✔️CVs are commonly split into distinct sections: a professional profile, your skills, a summary of your career, and a section on your education and qualifications. Details are usually presented in snappy bullet points, led by powerful verbs, and bolstered with concrete statistics, to show off your skill set and talent.\n\nNote: Now that you have a clear idea about what CVs and resumes are, let’s look at a complete list of the differences between them:-\n\n✔️Length. Resumes are typically short and vary between one and two pages long at most. CVs, on the other hand, can be as long as necessary, and if you have a lot of experience, they can go for up to dozens of pages.\n\n✔️Detail. Resumes should only include the most relevant information about you, while CVs contain your entire career history.\n\n✔️Function. Resumes are more than enough for most job applications, while CVs are mainly used in academic settings. Whether you’re applying for a Ph.D. or for a position as a professor at a university, an academic CV is what you’re going to need.\n\n✔️Tailoring. Resumes should always be tailored to the specific job you’re applying to, so a single job search can include dozens of resumes when you’re applying to different companies. CVs are always the same, regardless of where you apply, although they get longer as you gain more experience and qualifications.\n\n✔️Focus. Resumes highlight your work experience, professional achievements, and most impressive skills, while CVs prioritize education, research experience, and publications.\n\n✔️References. Typically, you don’t need to list references on a resume unless the employer specifically requests them. However, academics are encouraged to include professional references in their CVs.",

But along the journey, he discovers something even greater — the power of dreams, faith, and personal growth.\n\n💭 The Alchemist reminds us that life’s real treasure isn’t Gold or Fame — it’s self-discovery.\nEach obstacle is a test of how much we truly believe in our purpose. The book teaches that:\n\n🌱 Dreams matter — they are the language of your soul.\n\n🔥 Courage and faith turn challenges into transformation.\n\n💎 The journey itself is often more valuable than the destination.\n\nFor every student who sometimes feels lost or unsure — Santiago’s journey says: “Keep walking. You’re closer than you think.” 🌞\n\n💬 What’s your “Personal Legend” — that one dream you truly want to chase?

His daughter, Yemariam Sintayehu, was a freshman student at Addis Ababa University in 2017 E.C.\n\nSadly, Yemariam is currently suffering from a severe mental health disorder, which has forced her to withdraw from her studies. She is undergoing intensive and long-term medical treatment, the cost of which is estimated at 10,000,000 ETB. The family has exhausted all available financial resources and properties and is no longer able to cover the treatment expenses.\n\nIn view of this critical situation, we humbly appeal to all students and compassionate individuals, in the name of God, to extend any possible medical or financial support to help save Yemariam’s life.\n\nBank Details for Support:\nCommercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)\nAccount Number: 1000018352846\n\nYour generosity, prayers, and solidarity will make a profound difference during this difficult time.\n\nWith sincere gratitude,",

But along the journey, he discovers something even greater — the power of dreams, faith, and personal growth.\n\n💭 The Alchemist reminds us that life’s real treasure isn’t Gold or Fame — it’s self-discovery.\nEach obstacle is a test of how much we truly believe in our purpose. The book teaches that:\n\n🌱 Dreams matter — they are the language of your soul.\n\n🔥 Courage and faith turn challenges into transformation.\n\n💎 The journey itself is often more valuable than the destination.\n\nFor every student who sometimes feels lost or unsure — Santiago’s journey says: “Keep walking. You’re closer than you think.” 🌞\n\n💬 What’s your “Personal Legend” — that one dream you truly want to chase?

    "text": "**How Your Phone Can Steal Your Dream Before You Even Enter the Department You Want**\nI have been observing many students spending most of their time on their phones — scrolling endlessly, sitting around the campus day and night, doing nothing meaningful. The most common excuse I hear is:\n“Classes haven’t properly started yet…”\n“Let’s have some fun first…”\n“Our section hasn’t begun lectures anyway…”\nBut what many don’t realize is that __habits are formed in silence.__ The way you spend your “free” time today will shape how you handle your academic responsibilities tomorrow.\nWhen you get used to scrolling, procrastinating, and sleeping 8+ hours a day, **you will carry that same habit even after classes start.** Then one day, reality will suddenly hit:\nYou’ll have multiple assignments, exams around the corner, group work waiting, and other commitments piling up. Instead of handling them confidently, you’ll feel overwhelmed.\nWorse, you may slowly drift away from your spiritual life as well , skipping prayers, fellowships, and religious responsibilities, justifying it with “I’m busy” when in reality, your __time was consumed by your phone long before you became busy.__\nAnd by the time you wake up to the problem, it may already be affecting your grades. Instead of choosing your dream department confidently, you may end up asking:\n\n**“Which department will accept me with my dropped grade?”**\nYour phone is not the enemy — your **relationship with it** is.\n**Take care of your time before your phone takes care of your future.\nProtect your dream before distraction steals it quietly.\n**\nHappy Monday 🎉\n\n@AAUNEWS1",
